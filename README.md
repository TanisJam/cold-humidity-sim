# Cold and Humidity Simulator


## Objective:
 By working on this simple simulator I try to learn about objects and classes of JS.

## What I did:
 - I structured the project on diferent files tryn to make it simple to work.
 - Learned how to use and manipulate css variable and calc function.
 - Created two classes. Slime extends from Life.
 - Dynamic background color linked to a humidity and temperature sliders.
 - To do that I found easiest use HSL();
 - Basic main loop with requestAnimationFrame() funtion.
 - When temperature change the behavior and size of the slimes change.
 - A lot of fun.

## What I want to do:
 - [ ] Add behavior for the humidity slider.
 - [ ] Make it working fine on mobile.
